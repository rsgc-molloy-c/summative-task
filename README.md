# Summative Task

Gravity Simulation

## Overall goal

My summative task will be a to extend the Motion class simulate two objects reaction to their respected gravitational forces on each other. I will modify the motion class so you can choose where the planets are placed and what mass they will have (how much force they will impose on other objects).

## Sub-goals

* extend Motion class to allow eclipses to be initially placed by the mouse
* modify the Motion class so the “mass” of the planets can be decided by the user
* give the planets initial velocities so they are not directly pulled towards each other.
* modify the visual representation of the Motion class to more closely resembly dandelion seeds
