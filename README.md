# Summative Task

Gravity Simulation

## Overall goal

My summative task will be a to extend the Motion class simulate two objects reaction to their respected gravitational forces on each other. I will modify the motion class to create a educational game about gravitational forces, with each level being more complex.

## Sub-goals

* extend Motion class to allow eclipses to be initially placed by the mouse
* have multiple “levels” to choose from
* 1:one object orbiting around the centre of the screen
* 2:object orbiting around a moving object
* 3:two objects orbiting around each other
* 4:two objects orbiting around each other, player is also affected by the gravitational field

##Final Questions

* 1:Everything the user needs to know is explained on the starting screen.
* 2:It is explained in the start screen but the user must use the arrow keys to control the player.
* 3:All the levels inherit properties from the vectors class.
* 4:All the functions have understandable names and the code is easy to follow, as well all of the variables have manful names.
* 5:The most important algorithm in the project is the Draw() method in the Motion class, it is where everything that the user sees is set up and drawn onto the screen.
* 6:There is a instruction blurb on the start screen explaining how to use the program
* 7:I have used source control to the best of my ability with frequent commits.
