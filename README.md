# Summative Task

Gravity Simulation

## Overall goal

My summative task will be a to extend the Motion class simulate two objects reaction to their respected gravitational forces on each other. I will modify the motion class to create a educational game about gravitational forces, with each level being more complex.

## Sub-goals

* extend Motion class to allow eclipses to be initially placed by the mouse
* have multiple “levels” to choose from
* 1:one object orbiting around the centre of the screen
* 2:object orbiting around a moving object
* 3:two objects orbiting around each other
* 4:two objects orbiting around each other, player is also affected by the gravitational field
